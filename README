Windows prerequisites
------------

The BaseClasses from DirectShow SDK is required to build some camera input-related parts of OpenCV on Windows. This SDK is found in the Samples\Multimedia\DirectShow\BaseClasses subdirectory of the Microsoft Platform SDK (or DirectX SDK 8.0 to 9.0c / DirectX Media SDK prior to 6.0), which must be built prior to the building of OpenCV.

The Epiphan SDK ...

Linux prerequisites
------------

* Installing Epiphan

The Epiphan SDK can be downloaded from
Before attempting to use your Epiphan frame grabber in linux, you should test it in your system following
the directives in http://www.epiphan.com/solutions_new/image-capture/how-to-install-frame-grabber-drivers-on-a-workstation-running-linux-and-view-the-grabbed-video/

* Installing ffmpeg

You should normaly install the libavXXX-dev packages and libswscale-dev package.

e.g. sudo apt-get install libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavfilter-dev libswscale-dev

* Installing libdc1394/libraw1394

The two libraries libdc1394 and libraw1394 can also be installed with a package tool. For instance, under Debian Linux, the libraries are installed with:
apt-get install libraw1394 and apt-get install libdc1394.

* Installing a firewire camera

In order to use a firewire camera under Linux, the four kernel modules named raw1394, video1394, ohci1394 and ieee1394 must be loaded. This is accomplished under Debian Linux using the command modprobe. modprobe raw1394 and modprobe video1394 are sufficient to activate all four modules. With the command lsmod | grep 1394, it can be checked whether the four modules have been successfully loaded. This command should list the above mentioned four modules. If this should not be the case, try to add each module individually with the command modprobe.
In order to allow a user or an application to access the interface to the camera, the user has to be registered in the appropriate groups (usually video) of the devices /dev/raw1394 and /dev/video1394, or the user privileges of the devices must be set appropriately. For this, root privileges are necessary. 

How to build
------------

1. Download ITK with video support:
git clone git://github.com/itkvideo/ITK.git

2. Download and build OpenCV 2.3
http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/

Under windows, there is some issue with linking to OpenCV libraries, use the following work around:
After building OpenCV 2.3, copy all .dll and .lib into "build/lib" including those in "build/3rdparty/lib"
In your CMakeLists.txt, call

find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)

include_directories(${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS})
link_directories(${OpenCV_LIB_DIR})
target_link_libraries(YourLib ${OpenCV_LIBS})

3. Build ITK with the following group modules
ITKGroup_VideoCommon
ITKGroup_OpenCV

4. Check out ITKVideoGrabber into "ITK/Modules/External" directory
git clone git://github.com/PatrickCheng/ITKVideoGrabber.git

For developer:
git clone git@github.com:PatrickCheng/ITKVideoGrabber.git

5. Run CMake on ITK, enable "Module_ITKVideoGrabber" and compile
