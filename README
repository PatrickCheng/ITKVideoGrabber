How to build
------------

1. Download ITK with video support:
git clone git://github.com/itkvideo/ITK.git

2. Download and build OpenCV 2.3
http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/

Under windows, there is some issue with linking to OpenCV libraries, use the following work around:
After building OpenCV 2.3, copy all .dll and .lib into "build/lib" including those in "build/3rdparty/lib"
In your CMakeLists.txt, call

find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)

include_directories(${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS})
link_directories(${OpenCV_LIB_DIR})
target_link_libraries(YourLib ${OpenCV_LIBS})

3. Build ITK with the following group modules
ITKGroup_VideoCommon
ITKGroup_OpenCV

4. Check out ITKVideoGrabber into "ITK/Modules/External" directory
git clone git://github.com/PatrickCheng/ITKVideoGrabber.git

For developer:
git clone git@github.com:PatrickCheng/ITKVideoGrabber.git

5. Run CMake on ITK, enable "Module_ITKVideoGrabber" and compile
